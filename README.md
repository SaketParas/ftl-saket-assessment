## Project Title : Fetch User Details using JSON

## About the Project : 
In this project, we have details if the user in the JSON from and we need to extract and also details of the particular user  should be displayed as a Model.

## Getting Started :
This Project code I have written on Visual Studio Code and pushed this code on Github which is open source platform and also I have deployed this project Netlify.

## Prerequisites :
First we need to have npm install in our system and also we need to have react install at the same time.


## Installing : 
step 1 : install npm , npx , React
step 2 : npx create-react-app ftl-assessment
step 3 : npm install react-router-dom
step 4 : npm start

## Different steps involved : 
After starting the server we need to move our JSON file inside the "src" folder and I have made JSON file inside the Data folder and Data folder is their inside the src folder and then can easily render the data present in Data.json file.

## until finished : 
As soon as we fetch the data from our JSON file, we  need to map over it and we can dynamically acces the particular details and also the data associated with it.

## Running the tests :
Different user details have their own IDs associated with id, and so on clicking particular user, only that particular user details should pop out as a model and we can close it.  

## Deployment :
This project is a live system and is deployed it on netlify i.e https://ftl-saket.netlify.app/

## Built With :
Deployed to netlify [npm run build]


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
